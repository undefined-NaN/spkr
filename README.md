## What is SPKR?

> SPKR allows presenters to improve on their public speaking abilities by way of crowdsourcing audience feedback. SPKR generates a unique link to a feedback form for a speaker's presentation that they can provide to audience members at the end of a talk. Audience members will be able to access the feedback form and rate the speaker's performance on criteria ranging from audience connection to body language. 
Once logged in, presenters will be able to track their overall rating on a specific criteria for a specific presentation as well as their improvement over multiple presentations. This feedback cycle lets users know what they are good at, what they can improve on, and if any changes in the way they present are accomplishing their goals. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/glorypod/spkr/blob/master/_PRESS-RELEASE.md)
